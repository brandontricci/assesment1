                <h2 class="page-header">How To Book</h2></p><p>
Please call or email us to confirm availability for your chosen tour, and ensure that you have reviewed our Booking Terms & Conditions. The easiest way to make a reservation is to contact us by telephone.<p></p>
A $500 non-refundable, per-person deposit, plus optional cancellation insurance premium is payable at the time of booking. We accept Visa, MasterCard and American Express for deposits and travel insurance. Your final balance is due 60 days prior to departure. An "Administrative Fee" will be assessed on all final payments; this fee will be discounted if payments are made by cheque, wire transfer or online bank transfer. Early enrollment is encouraged as group size is limited and some trips require greater preparation time. If airline bookings require a non-refundable payment in order to secure the lowest available fare, we will require an increase in deposit equal to the cost of the ticket(s). Once we have received your deposit, we will confirm your space and send you a confirmation package containing your trip itinerary; any visa/travel permit related documents; insurance information (if purchased); invoice; clothing and equipment recommendations; general information on your destination(s), and signature forms for you to complete and return to us. Your air tickets, final hotel list, final trip itinerary, baggage tags, will be sent out approximately 2-3 weeks prior to departure.<p></p>
FREQUENT FLYER POINTS<p></p>
If you want to redeem points for free travel, you must deal directly with the airline or reward scheme operator. If you want to collect points on an eligible ticket purchased from Immersed in Peru by Adventures Abroad, please provide us with your membership number prior to travel. You should always present your membership card at check-in and retain tickets and boarding card stubs until your account has been credited.<p></p>
SEATING AND SPECIAL REQUESTS<p></p>
We will assist in requesting preferred seating for your flights, if possible (some airlines do not offer pre-assigned seating). Please be aware, however, that it is ultimately up to the airline to honour this request. Airline overbooking practices and/or equipment changes may necessitate unannounced seating changes over which Immersed in Peru by Adventures Abroad has no control. If seating is very important to you, we suggest that you call the airline directly to reconfirm your seating at least two days prior to travel, and that you check in for your flight as early as possible.<p></p>
LAND ONLY ARRANGEMENTS<p></p>
If you prefer to make your own air arrangements, you can book most of our tours on a LAND ONLY basis. We advise all land only passengers to confirm the status of their chosen tour before making any non-refundable air arrangements. Please refer to our general Terms & Conditions pertaining to Land Only Bookings, Reservations, Payments, Cancellation, Refunds, Transfers, Baggage, etc.<p></p>

                <h2 class="page-header">BOOKING YOUR AIRFARE<p></p></h2>
Please contact us for an air quote. Our prices are based on the lowest available inventory on a limited number of scheduled airlines with which we have contracts, and are accurate only at the time of printing. Though we are usually very good at confirming the indicated price, fares can go up without notice, especially if you book late and lower fare space is sold out. If you want a no-obligation, tax-inclusive routing / fare quote from your home airport prior to booking your trip, please contact us.<p></p>
If you want a specific routing on a specific airline, please ask us for a quote, bearing in mind that we do not generally use charter airlines and that bookings made on carriers with which we do not have contracts may require full, non-refundable payment at time of reservation. These fares may also be higher than our published rates and / or attract extra administrative charges.<p></p></p>
