<h3>MESSAGE FROM CHRIS BOYCOTT, MANAGING DIRECTOR</h3></p><p>
With over twenty years of travel experience catering to small group travel, our cultural based tours have been very successful. Nevertheless, due to the feedback provided by our clients and our Tour Leaders has indicated that there is a desire on the part of many of our clients to experience exotic destinations that appeal to a more adventurous nature at a more affordable price. Immersed in Peru by Adventures Abroad has been developed with that type of client in mind.

SUSTAINABLE TRAVEL TIPS<p></p></h3>
Travelling the world is one of the most fulfilling experiences one can have in a lifetime, but like other life-altering choices it has the capacity to affect other people's lives as well. In recent times it has become increasingly important to many of our customers to behave in a way that supports the local economy, culture and ecology of the destination. Immersed in Peru by Adventures Abroad fully supports this mindset with local guides, small groups, and information about responsible travel.<p></p><h3>
A BRIEF SUMMARY:<p></h3></p>
Do your research. The more you know about a place before leaving, the more you can understand what is good practice while visiting. With a smattering of local language your experience will be all the richer.<p></p>
Try to leave as much packaging and waste material at home as possible. The less you carry, the less will be left behind.
Try to see things from your host's point of view. Cultural sensitivity need not be more complicated than that!
Try to conserve water, energy, and food. You will lessen the impact on the environment and leave more for the locals.
Avoid the temptation to buy souvenirs made from animal products. In most cases it is illegal to import these items and you may be supporting poaching.</p>
